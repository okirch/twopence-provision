Building a silver image

	Example: SLES15-SP3 plus selinux

	twopence provision --workspace ~/susetest/build init
	twopence provision --workspace ~/susetest build selinux
	twopence provision --workspace ~/susetest/build build \
			--base-platform leap-15.3 --feature selinux \
			leap-15.3-selinux
	rm -rf ~/susetest

	This loads the description of the base platform (leap-15.3) along
	with a list of available build features. Out of these build features,
	the invocation above enables selinux. It then proceeds to provision
	a basic Leap 15.3 VM, and performs all provisioning and build
	steps.

	Provisioning and building is done by assembling various shell
	snippets and executing them. Which shell snippets are used,
	and the order in which they are executed, is defined in the
	platform definition file (/etc/twopence/platform.d/leap-15.3.conf
	in the example above).

	Exactly how these shell scripts are executed is dependent on
	the provisioning backend. For the vagrant backend, the shell
	snippets are collated into the Vagrantfile, which is then
	processed by "vagrant up".

	The result of the build process is a vagrant image that
	is placed in ~/.twopence, along with some meta data that allows
	the twopence provisioner to pick it up later.

	The above build command would build a vagrant image that
	is based on Leap 15.3, and has selinux enabled. The resulting
	image can be referenced by specifying "selinux-runtime-15.3" as
	platform.

Provisioning a test cluster

	Example: run the rpc test case

	Create a file named testrun.conf with the following content:

	  role "default" {
		platform	"leap-15.3-selinux";
		repositories	"twopence";
	  }

	This specifies the default configuration for all nodes (you can specify
	different platforms for each node, or each role). Incidentally, this will
	use the image created just above.

	twopence provision --workspace ~/susetest init \
		--config testrun.conf --config /usr/lib/twopence/rpc/testcase.conf
	twopence provision --workspace ~/susetest create

	/usr/lib/twopence/rpc/run --config ~/susetest/status.conf

	twopence provision --workspace ~/susetest destroy
