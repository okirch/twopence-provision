Building a silver image

	Example: SLES15-SP3 plus selinux

	twopence provision --workspace ~/susetest init
	twopence provision --workspace ~/susetest build selinux
	rm -rf ~/susetest

	This loads a build.conf file from /usr/lib/twopence/provision/selinux,
	and provisions a build node using the base platform. The base platform
	is defined in build.conf.

	For the time being, bring-up and building is rolled into one;
	the entire process is coded in selinux/Vagrantfile

	The result of the build process is a vagrant image that
	is placed in ~/.twopence, along with some meta data that allows
	the twopence provisioner to pick it up later.

	The above build command would build a vagrant image that
	is based on SLES15-SP3, and has selinux enabled. The resulting
	image can be referenced by specifying "selinux-runtime-15.3" as
	platform.

Provisioning a test cluster

	Example: run the rpc test case

	Create a file named testrun.conf with the following content:

	  role "default" {
		platform	"selinux-runtime-15.3";
		repositories	"testbus";
	  }

	This specifies the default configuration for all nodes (you can specify
	different platforms for each node, or each role). Incidentally, this will
	use the image created just above.

	twopence provision --workspace ~/susetest init \
		--config testrun.conf --config /usr/lib/twopence/rpc/testcase.conf
	twopence provision --workspace ~/susetest create

	/usr/lib/twopence/rpc/run --config ~/susetest/status.conf

	twopence provision --workspace ~/susetest destroy
